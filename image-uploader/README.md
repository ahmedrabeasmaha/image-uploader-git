<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExYmMzMjhiNjBhZjU2ZWYwYWNlMzMyNGFhZjAzYmE0MTkxODc2OTdiOCZjdD1n/7J7dQJ5MEP5ssbfNqo/giphy.gif)

Implementing a user-friendly interface and functionality, and focusing on security and scalability, you can create an app that provides a valuable service to users and stands the test of time.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Material Icons](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/material_icons)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

An image uploader app typically has a variety of features that allow users to upload and share their images easily and efficiently. Two popular features of an image uploader app are drag and drop and copy link.

Drag and drop is a feature that allows users to simply drag and drop their images from their computer or mobile device directly onto the image uploader app. This eliminates the need for users to manually browse for their files and select them one by one, saving time and effort. The drag and drop feature is typically accompanied by a visual indicator that shows users where they can drop their files.

Copy link is another useful feature that allows users to quickly and easily share their uploaded images with others. After uploading an image, the user can simply click on a "copy link" button, which generates a unique link that can be shared with others. This link can then be pasted into an email, chat message, or social media post, allowing others to view the image with just one click.

Overall, these features make the image uploading and sharing process simple, intuitive, and convenient for users.

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
